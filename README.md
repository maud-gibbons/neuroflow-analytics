Part 1
Question: Given the information you have and any light research youâ€™d like to do on the topic, what insights can you draw? 

Answer: Patients are not diligent about reporting their mood, stress, etc. daily. Patients are more likely to use the app when prompted to do so, however sometimes they ignore the alerts. 

Qusetion: What assumptions have you made about the data? 

Answer: 1. The pateints are being honest. 
        2. The target for the mood and sleep attributes is high, ie 'Great' or 'Good'.
        3. The target for the stress attributes is low, ie 'Not at all' or 'slightly'.
        4. The mood and sleep attributes are inversely correlated with stress.
        5. The data is highly subjective. A stress level of 4.0 will be different for each patient.
        6. Patients will have a bias in reporting highly negative and/or highly positive instances of mood, sleep, and stress.

Question: What are 2-3 additional pieces of information that would be important to collect?

Answer: Patients should be asked to categorise their stress. For example, is work or faimily or relationships their primary cause for their stress. Patients with stress-related habits, ie tooth grinding, nail biting, etc., could be asked to record instances of these behaviours. The time and date of the patients therapy sessions should also be recorded.
